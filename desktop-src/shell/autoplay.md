# Creating an AutoRun-enabled CD-ROM Application

AutoRun is a feature of the Windows operating system. It automates the procedures for installing and configuring products designed for Windows-based platforms that are distributed on CD-ROMs. When users insert an AutoRun-enabled compact disc into their CD-ROM drive, AutoRun automatically runs an application on the CD-ROM that installs, configures, or runs the selected product.

> [!Note]  
> For AutoRun to work, the CD-ROM drive must have device drivers that detect when a user inserts a compact disc and notify the system.

The following sections discuss how to implement an AutoRun-enabled CD-ROM application.
